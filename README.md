This repository contains the data used in the manuscript "The image-based method for measurement of circumferential blade wear of end mill". The tool is an spiral end mill. The charge coupled device were used to acquire the image data, as described in the manuscript. All the data are the original image data. For the names of the data files, for example 'D16_12_60.mat',The first letter represents the diameter, the next two numbers represent tool diameters (unit: millimetre). The number of the second position represents the number of measurements in one rotation of the tool. The last number represents the amount to be collected for each acquisition angle.
